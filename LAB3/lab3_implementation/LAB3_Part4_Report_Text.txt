--- CONTROLLER SELECTION SUMMARY ---

Plant M1: SIMC Controller
Plant M2: SIMC Controller

--- M1 JUSTIFICATION ---

For the M1 plant (4th-order system with delay), the SIMC tuning method
was selected based on comprehensive multi-criteria analysis. This controller
achieved the highest overall performance score (67.5/100) when evaluated against
weighted criteria including speed (20%), overshoot (25%), robustness (30%),
and noise rejection (25%).

Key performance metrics on the reduced FOPDT model:
  - Settling Time: 8.54 s
  - Overshoot: 4.05%
  - Gain Margin: 9.94 dB
  - Phase Margin: 61.35 degrees

When tested on the original 4th-order plant, the controller maintained
stable performance with 6.81% overshoot and 8.77 s settling time,
validating the effectiveness of the FOPDT model reduction approach.

--- M2 JUSTIFICATION ---

For the M2 plant (3rd-order non-minimum phase system), the SIMC tuning method
was selected. This controller achieved the highest overall score (71.1/100)
and demonstrated superior handling of the inverse response characteristic
inherent to non-minimum phase systems.

Key performance metrics on the reduced FOPDT model:
  - Settling Time: 13.41 s
  - Overshoot: 4.05%
  - Gain Margin: 9.94 dB
  - Phase Margin: 61.35 degrees

--- METHODOLOGY RECAP ---

Three PID tuning methods were evaluated:
1. Ziegler-Nichols (Z-N): Classic FOPDT method, typically aggressive
2. AMIGO: Balanced approach by Astrom & Hagglund
3. Skogestad SIMC: Conservative, robust IMC-based method

Controllers were compared using:
  - Time domain: Step response (rise time, settling time, overshoot)
  - Frequency domain: Bode (noise sensitivity), Nyquist (margins)
  - Stability: Root locus, gain/phase margins
  - Validation: Testing on original higher-order plants

--- CONCLUSIONS ---

The selected controllers provide optimal balance between performance and
robustness for their respective plants. The SIMC method for M1 and
SIMC method for M2 outperformed alternatives in weighted multi-criteria
evaluation, demonstrating that no single tuning method is universally optimal.
Controller selection should consider plant characteristics, application
requirements, and performance trade-offs.
